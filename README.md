code samples:

morabot: simple twitter bot

Searches for users that have tweeted the word playoffs, and responds to them

a youtube video if you don't get the reference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7fjDS0jKiE

ncibgrabber: script I made to extract piR numbers from NCBI database

Both files require accessory files that are not included - thus they will not run, they are just meant to 
sample how I code.
